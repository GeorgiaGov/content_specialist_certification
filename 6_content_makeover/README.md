# Content Makeover
Over time, our agency websites tend to grow like weeds. You know it needs an overhaul, but don’t know where to begin. What’s working and what’s not? What should you delete or revise? In this class, we’ll look at the big picture of your site. You’ll take stock of everything on your site with a Content Inventory and use data to determine how your site can best serve up what people really need.
