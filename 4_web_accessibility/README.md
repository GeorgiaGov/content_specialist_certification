# Web Accessibility
Your content must be accessible for it to reach everyone. Not only does accessibility help people with disabilities, it often improves everyone’s experience. While our platform is designed and built for accessibility, it’s up to our agencies to create, maintain, and manage content that is accessible. In this class, you’ll learn more about accessibility and how to create accessible documents.
