# Citizen Journey Mapping
Once you’ve completed the Personas workshop, you’re ready to dig a little deeper. Now that you know who your audience is, we’ll look into their journeys and interactions with your agency. By understanding your citizens’ journeys, you can start to identify where they hit roadblocks and how to improve the process.

See and comment on the [Citizen Journey Mapping Google Slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RioP5tZvxGcAtZkl2xYcxn9FTftv8umIyBjbvbsjVuw/edit?usp=sharing).

## Objective
Understand how citizens interact with your agency and how your current site performs for your various personas.

## Topics
- **What do my users see?** We examine realistic situations based on your personas. People are trying to access various information from your agency based on their individual need. Does your content deliver?
- **Stress Cases:** We can’t always imagine our users in the perfect situation with plenty of time. We talk about “the crisis persona” and how distress affects a user’s experience.
- **Citizen Journey Mapping:** We identify each stage of citizens’ interactions with your agency, defining their goals, actions, emotional state, thoughts, and touch points for each.

## What You'll Get
- Another step towards completing your personas and empathy map
- A customer journey map
