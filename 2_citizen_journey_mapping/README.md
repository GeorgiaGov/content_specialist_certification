# Citizen Journey Mapping
Once you’ve completed the Personas workshop, you’re ready to dig a little deeper. Now that you know who your audience is, we’ll look into their journeys and interactions with your agency. By understanding your citizens’ journeys, you can start to identify where they hit roadblocks and how to improve the process.
