# Writing for the Web
What good is content if no one can understand it? In government, it can be tricky to balance the “official” language with what’s easiest for citizens to comprehend. In this course, we’ll focus on making your writing more readable and accessible to people of all abilities. Then we’ll close by preparing editorial style guides that you can take back to your agency and share with other content contributors.
